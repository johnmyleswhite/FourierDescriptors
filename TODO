(1) Get roxygen to work properly; update in place documentation.

(2) Test suite is dreadfully lacking.

(3) Explain actual algorithm in documentation.

(4) Implement getter and setter methods for amplitude and phase.

(5) Find a better default for the number of points used to plot a Fourier
    descriptor. It should depend on the complexity of the input.
